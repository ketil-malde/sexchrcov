This repository contains a set of scripts to classify
contigs/scaffolds by sequencing coverage.  This approach can be useful
to identify candidate sex chromosome sequences, and also to reveal the
sex determination system (e.g., XY or ZW).  Please note that this is
not in any way a ready to use tool, but rather documentation that may
(or may not) be useful and instructive if you are trying to do
something similar.  All items in this repository are released in the

  map.sh - map sequences (give a fastq file as the input parameter) with bwa
      Use GNU parallel to run multiple processes in parallel.

Then do sorting and indexing with 'bwa sort' and 'bwa index'.

Use the 'atcount' tool to get genome composition statistics:

  atcount < *.fa > atcounts

col1 = AT%, col2 = n-counts.  Alternatively, use:

  ncount.sh - for fasta-files with a single line of sequence data,
      count the non-N characters in each sequence.

To index the genome:

  samtools faidx B_acuto-0.0.scaffold.fa > B_acuto-0.0.scaffold.fa.fai

col1 = length (also in atcounts). 

  combinestats.sh - combine multiple outputs from samtools idxstats, and
      prepend atcounts

Generate plots (specific to Minke data, adjust parameters to fit):

  plot.sh - generate a set of plots based on the output from
      combinestats
