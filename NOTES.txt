Use map.sh to map sequencees in parallel
Also, do sorting and indexing

atcount < *.fa > atcounts c1 = AT%, c2 = n-counts
samtools faidx > *.fai  c1 = length (also in atcounts)

combinestats.sh - combine multiple outputs from samtools idxstats, and
                  prepend atcounts

plot.sh - plot based on output from combinestats
